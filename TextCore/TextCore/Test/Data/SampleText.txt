[edit]History

[edit]Early Years, Pikul EP (2002-2005)
The band members are friends who had played together previously or in mutual friends' bands. They got their start in many of the most important L.A. clubs, most often at Silverlake Lounge or nearby Spaceland, and began to draw a strong following upon the release of the Pikul EP.
The band originated in L.A.'s Silver Lake music scene, home of Rilo Kiley and others.[1]
The band was originally called A Couple of Couples. Their current name comes from an liquor store across from the Silverlake Lounge and near their house at Sunset and Silverlake Blvds in Los Angeles. In interviews, however, the band often say their name is more of "a state of mind,"[2] supposedly from living so close to everything an L.A.-based indie rock band would need late at night. For Pikul, fellow Silverlaker Tanya Haden was enlisted to play cello.[3] Pikul has sold 55,000 copies to date.[citation needed]
[edit]Carnavas (2006-2007)
On September 26, 2006, the band released their debut full-length album Carnavas. Two of the album's four singles, "Lazy Eye" and "Well Thought Out Twinkles," would hit the top 10 of the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 2007. The band finished a three week tour opening for Australian rockers Wolfmother on December 9, 2006, and later toured with OK Go and Snow Patrol on their U.S. spring tour, which ended on April 10, 2007. The band also played at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California on April 27, 2007 and would play various concerts for Modern Rock formatted radio stations in the US throughout the year.
The band also toured the UK and Ireland while Carnavas was released there on May 28, 2007. They opened for Foo Fighters in Edinburgh, Scotland, and Dublin, Ireland. They also opened for the Kaiser Chiefs during their European tour.
Carnavas peaked at #80 on the Billboard 200, and has sold 435,000 copies since its release.[citation needed]
[edit]Swoon (2008-Present)
It was announced through Alternative Press Magazine Issue #243 that the band's second album would be titled Swoon. It includes 10 tracks and, instead of having a straightforward mid-tempo sound, Aubert described it as "Some songs are very quiet and delicate, [while] others are just fucking loud."[4] The album was released on April 14, 2009 to positive reviews. It debuted at #7 selling approximately 43,000 copies in its first week. Swoon has sold 285,000 copies so far.[citation needed]
The first single released was "Panic Switch", which quickly aired in heavy rotation on VH1 and MTV music video shows. The song also received worldwide rotation on the radio airwaves. Silversun Pickups was confirmed to play the 2009 Voodoo Music Experience Festival over the Halloween weekend.[5]
In 2009, the band performed "Catch and Release", "Panic Switch", "Lazy Eye", "Well Thought Out Twinkles", "Growing Old is Getting Old", and "Kissing Families" for MTV Unplugged.

In early December 2009, the band was nominated in the Best New Artist category for the 52nd Grammy Awards. Their nomination drew some controversy, because the band was already moderately successful before the 2008-2009 nominating year, although this was mainly due to misunderstandings involving the selections of Best New Artist nominees.[6] However, they lost to the Zac Brown Band. They supported Placebo on their Winter 2009 European tour. Upon release of Swoon, they toured with Manchester Orchestra as main support. Also, in spring 2010 the band toured with Muse for their extensive US tour.[7] They toured North America again in summer 2010 with Against Me! and The Henry Clay People.[8] They toured with Australian rock band Birds of Tokyo in September 2010 and ended an 18 month tour in support of Swoon at Austin City Limits. The band is now planning their third studio album.[9]
[edit]Musical style and influences

The band's sound, often encompassing multiple overdubs of distorted guitars, is frequently compared to that of The Smashing Pumpkins,[10][11][12][13] while the band members have said they are heavily influenced by artists such as My Bloody Valentine, Pixies, The Velvet Underground, Elliott Smith, Sonic Youth, Sweet, Modest Mouse, Sunny Day Real Estate and Secret Machines as well as numerous other artists with lesser publicity.
